Introduction:
-------------
Mostly everyone of you will use traceroute frequently to find out about the
route to a remote host. But the output of traceroute differs from platform to
platform. This is no problem for humans - but if you want to tell a computer how
read the output of "traceroute" or "tracert" you have to set up certain parsing
rules. Net_Traceroute helps you parsing the output by providing array-structures
that contain all data from the traceroute-output.


Documentation, tutorials etc.:
------------------------------
Have a look at the example in docs/examples/. Together with the API-reference
this should easily get you started. Hey, Net_Traceroute is not *that* difficult
to use :-))
